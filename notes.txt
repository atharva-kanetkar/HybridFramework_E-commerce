Steps involved in creating a framework 
 
1) Creating folder structure.

2) Adding Dependencies.

3) Adding one test case - Account registration.

4) Create a base page, the Base page will have one constructor and initialize the driver, and every other page will extend base page.

5) Create locators and action methods for home page

6) Create locators and actions methods for Register page

7) Used RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic method from Common-lang repository to generate random email for register page

8) Create base class in test cases and keep the common methods to reuse (setup, teardown, randomnumbers, strings etc)

9) Every Test case now will extend base class (Launching the website, teardown, common methods etc)

10) And every object class will extend base page (Initialization of driver)
