Steps involved in creating a framework 
 
1) Creating folder structure.

2) Adding Dependencies.

3) Adding one test case - Account registration.

4) Create a base page, the Base page will have one constructor and initialize the driver, and every other page will extend base page.

5) Create locators and action methods for home page

6) Create locators and actions methods for Register page

7) Used RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic method from Common-lang repository to generate random email for register page

8) Create base class in test cases and keep the common methods to reuse (setup, teardown, randomnumbers, strings etc)

9) Every Test case now will extend base class (Launching the website, teardown, common methods etc)

10) And every object class will extend base page (Initialization of driver)

11) Creating Logging for test cases

12) Added Log4j-core and log4j-api Dependancies

13) Added log4j2.xml under test resources 

14)Under Base class, create logger variable 

15) Under test case, add the necessary logs 

16) Run tests on desired Browser/Cross browser 

17) In master.xml, add parameter with name as "OS" and "Browser", -> this master.xml we will use
when we need to run the test cases individually on desired browser (not parallely)

18) We will create another xml file for parallel/cross browser testing, where we have created 3 testcases
with 3 browsers and put parallel = "tests" at suite level

19) Adding config.property file under test resources

20) Load the config file in base class in set up method with help of Properties

21) Create Loginpage and MyAccountPage page objects

22) Create TC002_LoginTest
