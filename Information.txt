Log levels 

All < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fatal < Off

If you set log level as debug, we will get all the logs from debug to fatal
If you set log level as warn, we will get all logs from warn to fatal
If you set log level as "All", you get all logs from trace to fatal
If you set log level as "Off", you will get no logs 


Appenders -> Where to generate logs ( Console/File) -> we prefer file 
Loggers -> what type of logs generate (All < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fatal < Off)

Steps to generate logs 
1) Add log4j2.xml file under src/test/resources (copy from Internet)
2) Update BaseClass (Create logger variable )
3) Add log statements to Account Registration test (logger.info(), logger.debug(), etc...)



---------------------------------------------------
config.properties file -> Will contain common data like url, login details, customer details, etc
This will be used across multiple test cases
-----------------


Steps we did for our framework,
1) Added Base Test case : Account Register.java
2) Added logs to test cases using log4j2
3) Run tests on Desired browser/parallel testing
4) Read common values from config.properties file
